# SEO Agency Automation System

An AI-powered system for automating content creation, web building, and SEO optimization for law firms specializing in criminal defense and personal injury.

## Overview

This project implements an automated content creation and website building system powered by OpenAI's Assistants API. It orchestrates a team of AI agents to:

1. Research and analyze SEO keywords for law firms
2. Plan website structure and content strategy
3. Generate high-quality, SEO-optimized content
4. Create images using DALL-E 3
5. Convert markdown content into Next.js pages
6. Provide a review dashboard for quality control

## Features

- **AI Agent Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple AI agents with specialized roles (Team Lead, SEO Manager, Content Manager, etc.)
- **SEO Optimization**: Implements keyword research and optimization for law firm websites
- **Content Generation**: Creates high-quality, legally accurate content for criminal defense and personal injury practices
- **Image Generation**: Automatically generates relevant images using DALL-E 3
- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides a user interface for reviewing and approving content
- **Content Preview**: Allows reviewing content before publication

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4 and DALL-E 3

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd my-law-firm-site
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
NODE_ENV=development
```

4. Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

## Usage

### Development Mode

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

### Content Generation

To start the automated content generation process:

```bash
npm run seo-agency
```

This command runs the orchestration script that:
1. Sets up AI agents
2. Creates a communication thread between agents
3. Generates content based on SEO research
4. Processes images from content placeholders
5. Builds Next.js pages from markdown content

### Admin Dashboard

Visit `http://localhost:3000/admin` to access the content review dashboard where you can:
- View generated content
- Approve or request changes
- Preview content before publishing

### API Endpoints

The system includes mock API endpoints for SEO functionality:
- `/api/keywords` - Returns sample keyword research for law firms

## Directory Structure

- `/content`: Stores markdown content generated by AI agents
- `/public/images`: Stores generated images
- `/public/videos`: Stores video content (if any)
- `/src/app`: Next.js application code
  - `/api`: API endpoints
  - `/admin`: Admin dashboard interface
  - `/preview`: Content preview pages

## System Architecture

The system follows the architecture outlined in the agent instructions:

1. **OpenAI Assistants API**: Provides the AI agents with specific roles
2. **Next.js with Tailwind CSS**: Builds the web interface
3. **DALL-E 3**: Generates images based on content requirements

## Important Notes

- This system is designed to assist with content creation but requires human review
- The API key should be kept secure and never committed to version control
- Running the orchestration process will incur charges on your OpenAI account
